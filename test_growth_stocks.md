## INVESTMENT RATIONALE

These growth-focused recommendations target companies with strong revenue growth, positive price momentum, and favorable
analyst sentiment. Unlike traditional value investments, these stocks offer higher upside potential but also come with
increased volatility and risk.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

Consider the following risk management strategies for these growth positions:
1. Position sizing is equal across all recommendations to limit single-stock exposure
2. Use stop-loss orders 10-15% below purchase price to limit downside
3. Consider scaling into positions over time rather than all at once
4. These should complement (not replace) your core value holdings

I've focused on finding stocks similar to your examples (NBIS, RXRX) with strong growth characteristics and prices
under $20 per share, emphasizing companies with promising fundamental and technical indicators.
