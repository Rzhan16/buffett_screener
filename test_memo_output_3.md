The selected stocks represent a balanced portfolio of high-quality companies with strong fundamentals. Each has been selected based on their exceptional F-Score, indicating strong financial health across profitability, leverage, and operating efficiency metrics.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

Each position is sized to represent 20% of the portfolio, creating a balanced allocation across five high-quality companies. This approach provides both diversification and meaningful exposure to each holding.

The selected companies have demonstrated resilience during economic downturns and have strong competitive advantages ("moats") that should enable them to maintain their market leadership positions over the long term.

As always, our approach is to buy wonderful companies at fair prices,
with a long-term perspective. The current selection represents businesses
with strong fundamentals trading at reasonable valuations.

Sincerely,
